- **Machine Learning**: PyTorch, TensorFlow, XGBoost, LightGBM
- **Visualization**: Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly, Altair

#### R Packages
- **Base**: R with essential packages
- **Tidyverse**: Data manipulation and visualization
- **Bioconductor**: Bioinformatics tools

#### Bioinformatics
- Biopython, BioServices, Pysam
- Samtools, BCFtools, Bedtools
- BLAST, HMMER, MUSCLE

#### Development Tools
- Jupyter Lab & Notebook
- Testing and linting tools
- Version control utilities

## Customization

The environment can be customized by editing the `environment.yml` file that's generated during setup. After making changes, update your environment with:

```bash
conda env update -f environment.yml
```
